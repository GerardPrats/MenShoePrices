This database has a total of 48 features, but not all of them provide us with information for classification.
Amazon Identifier, for example, is a random code that doesn't really provide us with much information. The actually
important columns, here, will be marked with a (*).

(*) id: serial number of the product.
    - We will replace all values in this column by indexes from 1 to the number of rows.
asins: amazon identifier.
(*) brand: brand name of the product (or "unbranded" if none applies).
(*) categories: list of category keywords used for this product.
    - We will obtain each unique category and create a column for each, checking whether or not the product belongs to it.
(*) colors: instead of checking for each individual color, we will check whether or not the product offers several colors or not.
count: this column is completely null, which means we will not consider it.
(*) dateadded: date the product was added to the database.
(*) dateupdated: most recent update date of the product.
(*) descriptions: list of descriptions for the product in various sources.
    - We could consider either: the specific words that appear in the description, for analysis.
    - The amount of descriptions.
dimension: length, width, height of the product. This column has far too many null values to take it into account (85%).
ean: EAN codes for the product, same as the amazon identifier.
(*) features: contains different features for the product (Gender, Shoe Size, Shoe Category, etc.)
flavors: not used.
imageurls: each product has its own image, we cannot make a prediction based around the URL.
isbn: reserved for books.
keys: unique for each product, we cannot use it to make predictions.
(*) manufacturer: though there are a lot of null values in this column, we could take them as "None" if there was none involved.
(*) manufacturernum: might be more useful than manufacturer, as there are not as many null values (22% vs 65%).
(*) merchants: the date seen and the name might be useful; more recently seen products might have better sales.
name: the name of each unique shoe will not be useful for classification.
(*) prices_amountmin: minimum value listed for the price. -|
(*) prices_amountmax: maximum value listed for the price  -|--> might be useful to take the mean of both values.
prices_availability: most values are null.
prices_color: most values are null.
(*) prices_condition: tells us the condition of the product.
    - Will mostly be useful to analyze whether a product is new or not.
prices_count: all values are null.
prices_currency: almost all values are USD, it won't be useful to analyze the data.
price_dateadded && prices_dateseen: dateadded and dateupdated already serve this purpose well enough.
price_flavor: makes no sense with the current database.
(*) prices_issale: checks whether the product is on sale or not.
prices_merchant: merchants serves this purpose well.
prices_offer: issale already serves this purpose well.
prices_returnpolicy: most values are null.
(*) prices_shipping: we can check whether the product 1. doesn't offer shipping. 2. offers free shipping. 3. offers charged shipping.
prices_size: most values are null.
prices_source: almost all values are null.
prices_sourceurls: all values are unique, there's no use using this column.
prices_warrantly: almost all values are null.
quantities: almost all values are null.
(*) reviews: might be useful to check which products have reviews and which don't, whether the review has been recent, and whether the review has been poositive.
(*) sizes: the important part here is checking whether the product offers multiple sizes or not.
skus, sourceurls, upc, vin, websiteids, weight: mostly contains unique values or mostly null values, not useful.
