# MenShoePrices

This repository uses the Men's Shoe Prices database in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sureshmecad/mens-shoe-prices) in order to analyze data and figure out trends in different products. There is also a notebook included in which I clean the data and present a possible model that predicts whether a product will receive a review or not.

In order to execute the "run.py" file or the notebook, it'll be necessary to first manually download the dataset's csv and add it to a "data" folder in the root of the project. Due to GitHub's size limit, I cannot put it in this repository.
